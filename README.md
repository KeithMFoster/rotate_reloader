# Rotate Reloader

Have there been times that your custom theme doesn’t look correctly when you rotate your mobile device? Did your page get stuck and didn’t adjust with the rotation?

These things did happen to me. The responsive theme didn’t change with the abrupt screen size change. A simple page load reloaded the page and everything was correct again.

This plugin uses a simple JQuery script within the PHP plugin to determine an orientation change and causes the page to reload. There is no interaction with the plugin, everything is done automatically.
